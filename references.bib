              data to address scientific questions. But citizen-science
              projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for
              science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a
              basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise,
              taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing
              cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields:
              population and distributions, conservation biologists,
              quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS
              and informatics specialists, application developers, and data
              administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through
              participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and
              control for data quality issues such as observer variability,
              imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal
              bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology,
              statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species
              distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad
              spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution.
              eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of
              students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land
              managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use
              community helps identify development priorities. As a result,
              eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing
              our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and
              having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their
              habitats.",

  abstract = "Conservation prioritization requires knowledge about organism
              distribution and density. This information is often inferred from
              models that estimate the probability of species occurrence rather
              than from models that estimate species abundance, because
              abundance data are harder to obtain and model. However,
              occurrence and abundance may not display similar patterns and
              therefore development of robust, scalable, abundance models is
              critical to ensuring that scarce conservation resources are
              applied where they can have the greatest benefits. Motivated by a
              dynamic land conservation program, we develop and assess a
              general method for modeling relative abundance using citizen
              science monitoring data. Weekly estimates of relative abundance
              and occurrence were compared for prioritizing times and locations
              of conservation actions for migratory waterbird species in
              California, USA. We found that abundance estimates consistently
              provided better rankings of observed counts than occurrence
              estimates. Additionally, the relationship between abundance and
              occurrence was nonlinear and varied by species and season. Across
              species, locations prioritized by occurrence models had only
              10-58\% overlap with locations prioritized by abundance models,
              highlighting that occurrence models will not typically identify
              the locations of highest abundance that are vital for
              conservation of populations.",

  abstract = "New technologies are rapidly changing the way we collect,
              archive, analyze, and share scientific data. For example, over
              the next several years it is estimated that more than one billion
              autonomous sensors will be deployed over large spatial and
              temporal scales, and will gather vast quantities of data.
              Networks of human observers play a major role in gathering
              scientific data, and whether in astronomy, meteorology, or
              observations of nature, they continue to contribute
              significantly. In this paper we present an innovative use of the
              Internet and information technologies that better enhances the
              opportunity for citizens to contribute their observations to
              science and the conservation of bird populations. eBird is
              building a web-enabled community of bird watchers who collect,
              manage, and store their observations in a globally accessible
              unified database. Through its development as a tool that
              addresses the needs of the birding community, eBird sustains and
              grows participation. Birders, scientists, and conservationists
              are using eBird data worldwide to better understand avian
              biological patterns and the environmental and anthropogenic
              factors that influence them. Developing and shaping this network
